# nothing
Nothing is a code that you inject into your PHP files and executes them only if you do it from an allowed IP in a MySQL table. If you do not visit the page from an allowed IP, it shows you an image and a simple form that redirects you to any web search engine.
It also generates a key that you will have to put in the search form that will validate the IP where you are.
